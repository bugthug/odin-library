# odin-library

[Preview](https://bugthug.github.io/odin-library)

If you'd like to test, a book for you to add is already included:
- Author: `Matt Kennard`
- Title: `The Racket`
- Number of pages: `416`
- Photo url: `./assets/The_Racket_(book).jpg`

I could style it a bit more (Using hackery with grid) but the point of this project is more objects and DOM manipulation, so I decided to end it before the design was 100% up to my standards.
